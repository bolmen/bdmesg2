# bdmesg2
Little app to view and compare Clover boot-logs.

Shows the latest Clover boot-log and stores it for later comparison.
If you start the app after the next reboot a new log will be retrieved and stored, and so on...

The current log can be compared side-by-side with previous logs to track changes wich can simplify optimising and trying different bios or Clover settings.
